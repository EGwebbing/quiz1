</div>

<h2>Guide content</h2> <!-- Summary of the guide content -->
<p><span lang=EN-GB>The following guide explains how to install and use the UCL QuizApp, 
a location-based mobile app. Here is the content of the guide:</p>
<p><i> - System requirements;</i></p>
<p><i> - How to install the app;</i></p>
<p><i> - How the app works (functionalities of both the left-side and the top-right menu).</i></p>


<h2>System requirements</h2> <!-- Basic requirements to run the app -->
<p>The app works on Android OS, while iOS and
Windows OS are not supported. The minimum supported version of Android is 5.1.0
(further information about the Android versions supported on the <a
href="https://build.phonegap.com/current-support">Phonegap website</a>).</p>
<p>The app must to be connected to the UCL VPN to load the points of interest. We recommend the 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cisco.anyconnect.vpn.android.avf&amp;hl=it">Cisco AnyConnect</a> 
app to establish the VPN connection; further information about
how to connect to the UCL VPN can be found on the following 
<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/remote-working/vpn">link</a>.</p>


<h2><span lang=EN-GB>How to install the app</h2> <!-- Installation process that should be followed by the user -->
<p>Since the app is not distributed through the Google Play Store, the user must allow the installation from 
<i>unknown sources</i> on his device, otherwise the app cannot be installed. Usually, this option is under the 
<i>security</i> section within the settings.</p>
<p>The installation process needs to be initialized from the following link: 
<a href="https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3148274/share">https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3148274/share</a>.</p>
<p><span >Once here the user has two options:</p>
<p><b>1-</b> Through their own mobile phone by scanning the QR code provided and by following the instructions supplied by the device to
complete the process;</p>
<p><b>2-</b> By downloading the .apk file on the PC and then connecting the phone to the computer to complete the installation on the mobile device.</p>


<h2>How the app works</h2> <!-- Explanation about how the app works by showing the main parts that compose the interface -->
<p>This is a location-based app that uses the capability of mobile devices to track the position of the user in order to
visualise questions related to some points of interest (mainly related to the UCL campus). The app is composed of three main parts: 
the main body, the left-side menu and the top-right menu.</p>

<h3>- The main body</h3>
<p>The main body contains the visualisation tools that allow the user to get the questions and answer to the quiz. This part consists of:</p>
<p><b>The map</b>: here the user can see their position and the location of the points of interest. Each point is associated to a question to be answered. 
The coordinates of the tracked position: this option lets the user see the coordinates of their position expressed in decimal degrees 
(further information about the coordinates can be found 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees">here</a>).</p>
<p><b>The question</b>: this section contains the question and the related answers that appear when the user is near enough to a point of
interest.</p>
<p><b>The check answer button</b>: once the user selects an answer they can check if it is correct by clicking this button.</p>

<h3>- The left-side menu</h3>
<p>This menu can be opened by tapping the top-left burger on the interface. Here the user has four options:</p>
<p><b>Load Points</b>: the button allows to load the points of interest. Before starting the game the points need to be loaded, or
else there are no questions to answer.</p>
<p><b>Track Location</b>: once clicked, the option activates the tracking and search for points nearby. If the user is close to
one of them a pop-up will appear and the question will be loaded, otherwise another pop-up will notify the user that they are far from 
any point of interest.</p>
<p><b>Get Questions</b>: the user can check if there is a point near enough by clicking this option. If so, a pop-up will appear and the
question will be loaded; if not another pop-up will notify the user that they are far from any point of interest.</p>
<p><b>Clear View</b>: this option cleans the map. The user should use this option if they want to restart the game.</p>
